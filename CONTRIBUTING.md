If anyone has any suggestions or would like to contribute then please either:

1) Make suggestions in the community section, and I may or may not implement any feature ideas etc.
2) Fork the repo, write the code yourself and submit pull requests to me.

At this time, this tool is very very basic. I just thought I'd start sharing more of my work.

Can only be a good thing, right? :)
